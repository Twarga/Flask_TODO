## Stack:
- Flask Microframework
- Semantic UI
- HTML 
- Render (Free Cloud Platform to Deploy App services ) 

>  utilized various stacks in separate branches to deploy the same app, aiming to learn from diverse stacks simultaneously and expand my understanding across multiple technologies : 

- Used Render in this branch to deploy the app.
- Employed Vagrant in the second branch to revisit and reinforce Vagrant skills.
- Utilized Ansible, Vagrant, and PostgreSQL in the third branch, marking my first experience with Ansible.
